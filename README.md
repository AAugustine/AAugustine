## Hi 👋 I'm Alex 

(she/her)

Coding since... 2013 - long story short, started in front end dev and made my way to the back end (JS, Ruby, Java, Python) 

Currently learning how to automate all the things!

Implementation Engineer on the GitHub Professional Services team, amateur coffee enthusiast, terrible golfer - it's a work in progress, and lover of all the pets (except spiders). ✨
